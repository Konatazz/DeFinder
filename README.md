# DeFinder

This is the artifact of the submission to ACM MM'24:"DeFinder: Interpreting Vulnerability in Deep Neural Networks via Explainable Test Inputs Generation". 
The interpretability module is from Yuan et al. ASE'22 "Unveiling Hidden DNN Defects with Decision-Based Metamorphic Testing", and part of the coverage implementation is from Yuan et al. ICSE'23 "Revisiting Neuron Coverage for DNN Testing: A Layer-Wise and Distribution-Aware Criterion".  
Usage:`generation_cifar.py`.Testcase generation for dataset cifar10.  
Usage:`g_mnist.py`.Testcase generation for dataset mnist.
