# DeFinder

This is the artifact of submission:"DeFinder: Error-Sensitive Testing of Deep Neural Networks via Vulnerability Interpretation". The interpretability module is partially derived from Yuan et al. ASE'22 "Unveiling Hidden DNN Defects with Decision-Based Metamorphic Testing", and part of the test coverage implementation are from Yuan et al. ICSE'23 "Revisiting Neuron Coverage for DNN Testing: A Layer-Wise and Distribution-Aware Criterion".
Usage:generation_cifar.py.Testcase generation for dataset cifar10.
Usage:g_mnist.py.Testcase generation for dataset mnist.
